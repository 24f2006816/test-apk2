# Zomato Landing Page Clone (Basic)

This project is a basic, single-file HTML implementation of a Zomato-like landing page. It showcases a responsive design using Tailwind CSS and provides a foundational structure for a food discovery platform's homepage.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
*   **Hero Section:** Prominent search bar for location and restaurant/dish discovery.
*   **Collections Section:** Displays curated collections of restaurants or dining experiences.
*   **Popular Localities:** Highlights popular dining areas with links.
*   **Basic Header & Footer:** Essential navigation and informational links.
*   **Single File:** All HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and JavaScript (minimal) are contained within `index.html` for easy deployment and viewing.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the page structure.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and responsive utilities (included via CDN).

## Setup and Usage

Since this is a single HTML file, setup is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the `index.html` content):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd zomato-landing-page-clone
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    Simply double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer, or open it via your browser's file menu.

    ```bash
    # On macOS
    open index.html

    # On Windows
    start index.html
    ```

That's it! The page will load directly in your browser.
